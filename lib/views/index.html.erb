      <p>Your wife hung on the refrigerator lock with a secret code, and now she and you are on a diet. Do you know what the code of four numbers between 1 and 6.</p>

      <p>The screen on the lock gives you tips:</p>

      <p>The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.</p>

      <p>A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.</p>

      <p>A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.</p>
